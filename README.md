As a geologist, I am interested in learning more about python coding to enable more efficient data gathering and analyzing.
This could apply to creating ArcGIS mapping operations, working in a Unix/Linux environment, or trouble-shooting database issues. I will also include examples I found useful from my experience in industry. 

Additionally, I'll hightlight any scripts I find interesting for personal use. 

On this page, I intend to share any scripts that fit the above criteria with corresponding metadata and links to helpful resources.
