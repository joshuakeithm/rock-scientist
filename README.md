As a geologist, I am interested in learning more about python coding to enable more efficient data gathering and analyzing.
This could apply to creating ArcGIS mapping operations, working in a Unix/Linux environment, or trouble-shooting database issues.  

On this page, I intend to share any scripts that I find useful and could be easily adapted for geotechnical problem-solving.
